        ## 2. It ends with a linear layer that represents the keypoints
        ## it's suggested that you make this last layer output 136 values, 2 for each of the 68 keypoint (x, y) pairs
        
        # As an example, you've been given a convolutional layer, which you may (but don't have to) change:
        # 1 input image channel (grayscale), 32 output channels/feature maps, 5x5 square convolution kernel

        ## Note that among the layers to add, consider including:
        # maxpooling layers, multiple conv layers, fully-connected layers, and other layers (such as dropout or batch normalization) to avoid overfitting
