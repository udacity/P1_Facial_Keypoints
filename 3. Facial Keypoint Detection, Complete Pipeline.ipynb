    "After you've trained a neural network to detect facial keypoints, you can then apply this network to *any* image that includes faces. The neural network expectes a Tensor of a certain size as input and, so, to detect any face, you'll first have to do some pre-processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Detect all the faces in an image using a face detector (we'll be using a Haar Cascade detector in this notebook).\n",
    "2. Pre-process those face images so that they are grayscale, and transformed to a Tensor of the input size that your net expects.\n",

    "6. Display the facial keypoints on each face.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: step 4 can be the trickiest because remember your convolutional network is only trained to detect facial keypoints in square, grayscale images where each pixel was normalized to lie in the interval `[0,1]`, and remember that each keypoint was also normalized during training to the interval `[-1,1]`.  This means that you need to perform this same pre-processing on your candidate face before you can give it to your trained model.\n",
